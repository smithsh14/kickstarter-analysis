Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was to perform a data analysis for an up and coming playwright, Louise, as she reivews thousands of crowdsouring campaigns as she looks to start her own campaign for her play "Fever". Her starting budget estimate is just at $10,000. To help her assess the crowdsourcing trends, this analysis will allow her to guage if she should move forward with crowdsourcing her project or find another alternative. In previous analysis a pre-populated dataset provided in Excel was used to sort, organize and analyize crowdsourcing data to determine if there are any trends/factors in crowdsourcing campgaings that lead to the success of certain projects.
### Purpose
Now that Lousie has analyzed previous trends, Lousie was able to close her campaign for her play and came close to her target goal in a fairly short amount of time. In this next phase, she is now interested in understanding if there are any trends/factors and what their relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Understanding this informoation will provide Lousie with a more in-depth look at the specifics in order to ensure her continued success. 
## Analysis and Challenges
For this analyis, we looked speficially at two seperate outcomes, launch date and goals to see if there were any relation associated between them. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the parameters of this project, we can see for theatre based crowdsourced projects, campaigns that were launched in the months of May and June there showed a higher number of both successful campaigns (111 and 100) and failed campaigns (52 and 49) with the highest number of canceled campaigns launched in the month of January. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the parameters of this project Louise came close to her initial estimated goal of $10,000. Based on that we were able to tease out and analysis every play within that subcategory and review the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns within the range of her funding goal. For this analysis we broke down the goal ranges into 12 range categories. Since Lousie came close to her goal but did not reach the exact amount, we reviewed the data within the range category between $5,000 and $9,999. Within that range, we can see that 55% of the campaigns within that range were successful, 45% failed and 0% were canceled. From this we can determine more campiagns are successful within this range than failed or canceled. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Utilizing this data set came with a few challenges and difficulties. The first being the shear enorimity of the data. In the initial dataset, there were over 4000 data ids crossing over several categories that had subcategories embedded within. One area of difficulity was organizing the data and teasing out only the information that would assist Lousie without removing any important data that could be useful in our final analysis. When narrowing down a large number of datasets, there has to be a clear understanding of exactly what needs to be focused on so that we are not in information overload. That was a challenge with this data set being so large. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conculsion is that the month of July has the highest overall number of both failed and successful campaigns and it would be interesting to study the factors leading to those high numbers in that month. 
Another conclusion is that in general, there are more successful crowdsourcing campaigns (53%) than failed campaigns (37%) so Lousie has a greater chance at getting her play crowdsourced than not.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One conclusion of that Outcomes based on Goals analysis is that the smaller campaign budgets have a higher number of projects than those projects with a higher campaign amount attached to it. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of the Kickstarter dataset is that it only spanned an 8 year period. Any data before 2009 and after 2017 were not included.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For Lousie, while we broke down the outcomes based on launch dates broken down by years, and knowing that there are more successsful and failed campaigns in the month of July, we could break that down even further into year (2009-2017) to see if there are years that had significanly lower/higher campaigns and begin to analyze any trends there may be there.
